/**
 * Produces a negative of the image by inverting each colour channel:
 * {@code channel' = 255 - channel}. The alpha channel is preserved.
 *
 * This achieves an effect similar to a photographic negative, which meaning dark areas
 * become light and vice versa, while colours are replaced by their complements.
 *
 * Implementation strategy: purely recursive, no loops used anywhere.
 * Rows are traversed via {@link #processRow}, which recurses on {@code y + 1}
 * until all rows are processed. Within each row, pixels are traversed via
 * {@link #processPixel}, which recurses on {@code x + 1} until the row ends.
 * This two-level approach keeps the maximum stack depth at
 * {@code max(width, height)} rather than {@code width × height}, preventing
 * stack overflow on real world images.
